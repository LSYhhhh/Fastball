## Welcome to the Fastball toolbox; a new method that uses frequency tagging to measure oddball responses in EEG data.

## The technique will allow you to measure MMN in single subjects in minutes, as recently demonstrated in our Neuropsychologia paper http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217302002 

## We are finalising our easily modifiable Psychopy code to allow you to run your experiment, and Matlab code to allow you to analyse your data. We hope to have everything up and ready to use by August 2017. 

## If you would like to receive an email to let you know when the toolbox is ready to use, or have any questions about the Fastball toolbox please email George Stothart at the University of Bath, G.Stothart@bath.ac.uk
