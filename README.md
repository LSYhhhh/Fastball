## Welcome to the Fastball toolbox; a new method that uses frequency tagging to measure oddball responses in EEG data.

## The technique will allow you to measure MMN in single subjects in ~1min of recording time, as recently demonstrated in:

## We are finalising our easily modifiable Psychopy code to allow you to run your experiment, and Matlab code to allow you to analyse your data. We will have everything up and ready to use by August 2017. 

## If you would like to receive an email to let you know when the toolbox is ready to use, or have any questions please email George Stothart at the University of Bath, G.Stothart@bath.ac.uk
