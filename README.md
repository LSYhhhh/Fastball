## Welcome to the Fastball toolbox; a new method that uses EEG frequency tagging to measure visual discrimination.

## The technique allows you to measure a single subject's ability to discriminate between categories of visual stimuli in as little as ~1min of EEG recording time, as recently demonstrated in our recent paper in Neuropsychologia, click <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217302002">here</a> to view.

## The toolbox contains Psychopy code to create and run your experiment, and Matlab code to analyse your data. 

## To get started please click <a href="https://github.com/gstothart/Fastball/wiki">here</a> to go to the wiki where you will find all the instructions you will need.
